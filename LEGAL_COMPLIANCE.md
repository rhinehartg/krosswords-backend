# Legal Compliance & Copyright Protection

This document outlines the copyright compliance measures implemented in the Krosswords application to protect against potential legal issues when generating puzzles based on popular media themes.

## Overview

Krosswords allows users to generate AI-powered crossword puzzles on any theme, including popular media like Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, etc. This capability requires careful attention to copyright and trademark law to ensure we remain legally compliant.

## Implementation

### 1. AI Prompt Guidelines (Backend)

The AI prompt template in `app/services/ai_generator_service.rb` includes explicit content guidelines:

**✅ Safe Practices:**
- Use only publicly available factual information
- Reference general knowledge and public domain facts
- Use character names in descriptive, non-copyrighted ways
- Create original clue wording
- Example: "The lion cub in The Lion King" → SIMBA (general knowledge)

**❌ Avoid:**
- Reproducing copyrighted text, dialogue, lyrics, or plot details
- Copying official copyrighted material
- Using trademarked material to imply endorsement
- Distributing verbatim protected content

### 2. User-Facing Disclaimers

#### AI Puzzle Generation Modal
Users see a clear legal notice when generating AI puzzles:
> **Legal Notice:** Puzzles generated from user themes may include references to popular media. This app is not affiliated with or endorsed by Disney, Marvel, or any other brand. AI-generated content uses only publicly available factual information.

#### Settings Screen
A comprehensive disclaimer in the Settings screen covers:
- Non-affiliation with any brand or trademark owner
- Use of public domain knowledge only
- Avoidance of copyrighted material reproduction
- User acknowledgment of content creation methods

## Legal Principles

### Generally Safe ✅
Creating puzzles inspired by or about popular culture is generally fine when:
1. Using public knowledge only (character names, general facts)
2. Writing original clues (not copying from official sources)
3. Not using official logos, images, or character artwork
4. Not marketing as "Official Disney Crossword" or similar

### Potential Issues 🚫
It becomes problematic when:
- Using trademarked names to imply endorsement
- Including copyrighted content (dialogue, images, text)
- Selling or heavily marketing puzzles that depend on brands
- AI model generates and distributes protected material verbatim

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Prompt Engineering**: The AI prompt explicitly instructs the model to avoid copyrighted content and use only public domain facts.

2. **Content Monitoring**: While automated, any user-generated content should be monitored for copyright violations.

3. **Documentation**: Clear disclaimers inform users about the nature of generated content.

4. **Legal Review**: Consider periodic review by legal counsel to ensure continued compliance.

### For Users

1. **Theme Selection**: Users can request any theme, but understand that generated content is educational/informational.

2. **Content Use**: Generated puzzles are for personal or educational use. Commercial use may require additional permissions.

3. **Acknowledgment**: By using AI generation, users acknowledge understanding of content generation methods.

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Ruby on Rails)

```ruby
# app/services/ai_generator_service.rb
DEFAULT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = <<~PROMPT
  IMPORTANT - Content Guidelines:
  - Use only publicly available factual information
  - Do NOT reproduce copyrighted text, dialogue, lyrics
  - For themed puzzles, use general public knowledge
  - Original clue wording only
  - If theme involves trademarks, use descriptive clues only
PROMPT
```

### Frontend (React Native/TypeScript)

```typescript
// Legal notices in CreatePuzzleModal.tsx and SettingsScreen.tsx
// Disclaimers prominently displayed in user interface
```

## Ongoing Compliance

### Recommended Actions

1. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update disclaimers as laws evolve
2. **User Education**: Ensure users understand the terms of service
3. **Content Monitoring**: Implement reporting mechanisms for copyright concerns
4. **Legal Counsel**: Consult with IP attorney for comprehensive protection
5. **Takedown Process**: Establish clear process for handling DMCA requests

### Monitoring

- Track AI prompt template updates
- Monitor user feedback for copyright concerns
- Review generated content samples periodically
- Stay informed about trademark/copyright law changes
